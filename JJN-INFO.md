This is **not** just some "fork and forget" repo. It’s a **working** DeFi arbitrage bot with real potential, but it needs **customisation and fine-tuning** to be actually useful. Right now, it's more of an **educational sandbox** than a plug-and-play money printer.

# JJN-INFO: DEFI-BOT

## Context and Purpose
This project is a **fork** of the [ExtropyIO DeFi Arbitrage Bot](https://github.com/ExtropyIO/defi-bot).  

### What It Does
✔ **Finds price mismatches** across decentralised exchanges (DEXes).  
✔ **Uses flash loans** to trade the spread without upfront capital.  
✔ **Executes trades via smart contracts** when profitable opportunities exist.  

### What It’s Built With
🟢 **Node.js** - Orchestrates API calls and logic.  
🟢 **Solidity** - Smart contract for executing arbitrage trades.  
🟢 **dYdX, Uniswap, 1inch, 0x** - Used for price fetching, trading, and flash loans.  
🟢 **Truffle** - Manages smart contract deployment.

## Key Files and Observations

### Root Files
- **`README.md`** → Well-written, includes a full breakdown of arbitrage concepts.  
- **`package.json`** →  
  - Uses outdated dependencies (`request`, `lodash`, etc.).  
  - Needs refactoring to modern libraries (`fetch`, `axios`, `ethers.js`).  
- **`truffle-config.js`** → Truffle project setup for smart contract compilation and deployment.  

### Important Folders
#### `src/` (Where the actual work happens)  
- **`fetchPrices.js`** → Fetches token prices from different DEXes.  
- **`arbitrage.js`** → Core logic for comparing prices and determining when to execute trades.  
- **`executeTrade.js`** → Interacts with the smart contract to perform swaps.  

#### `contracts/` (Solidity Smart Contracts)
- **`FlashLoanArbitrage.sol`** → Handles borrowing, trading, and repaying flash loans.  
- **`Ownable.sol`** → Standard contract to manage ownership and security.  

#### `migrations/` (Smart Contract Deployment)
- Contains scripts for deploying contracts using Truffle.

## How It Works
1️⃣ **Scans Prices** → Queries **multiple DEXes** (Uniswap, 1inch, 0x, etc.) for token prices.  
2️⃣ **Identifies Arbitrage Opportunities** → Finds price mismatches between DEXes.  
3️⃣ **Borrows Flash Loan** → Takes a loan (e.g., from dYdX) to execute the trade.  
4️⃣ **Executes Trade** → Buys low, sells high, repays loan, and keeps the profit.  

🚨 **Reality Check**:  
- **Flash loans require precise timing** → High gas fees & slippage can kill profits.  
- **MEV bots exist** → These guys front-run profitable trades **instantly**.  

---

## Things That Need Work
### 🚨 **1. Dependency Updates**
- **Replace `request` (deprecated)** → Use `axios` or `fetch`.  
- **Switch from `web3.js` to `ethers.js`** → Modern, lightweight alternative.  

### 🚨 **2. Gas Fee Optimisation**
- Right now, **it doesn’t prioritise gas efficiency**.  
- Needs a **gas estimator** to determine if a trade is even **profitable after fees**.  

### 🚨 **3. Multi-Flash Loan Support**
- Currently **hardcoded to dYdX**, but it could be extended to **Aave** or **Uniswap v3**.  
- **Alternative approach**: Simulate **triangular arbitrage** using Uniswap's routing.

### 🚨 **4. Logging & Error Handling**
- If something fails, the logs aren’t super clear.  
- Add **better debugging info** (e.g., why a trade failed).

## Next Steps
🚀 **1. Fix outdated dependencies**  
🚀 **2. Test arbitrage logic in a real environment (testnet first!)**  
🚀 **3. Improve smart contract efficiency to reduce gas costs**  
🚀 **4. Consider integrating a MEV protection strategy (e.g., Flashbots, private mempool execution)**  
🚀 **5. Implement stop-loss logic (to prevent unintended losses)**

## Git Repository
- **Forked From**: [ExtropyIO/defi-bot](https://github.com/ExtropyIO/defi-bot).  
- **Your Repo**: `git@github.com:jasonnathan/defi-bot.git`.  
- **Upstream Tracking**: Fork is still linked to the original repo.

## Final Thoughts
This **isn’t a guaranteed money-making bot**, but it’s an **incredibly valuable learning tool** for:  
- Understanding **DeFi arbitrage mechanics**.  
- Working with **flash loans** and **DEX aggregators**.  
- Optimising **smart contract execution costs**.  

**Future Me:** If you’re serious about **making this profitable**, you need:  
1️⃣ **A fast MEV-resistant execution strategy**.  
2️⃣ **A gas fee minimisation approach**.  
3️⃣ **Better real-world testing with slippage and liquidity considerations**.  

Otherwise, **this is just a great coding project** to understand **DeFi mechanics**. 🚀
